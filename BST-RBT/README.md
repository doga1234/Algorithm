# Binary Search Tree and Red Black Tree

## Overview

This project implements Binary Search Tree (BST) and Red-Black Tree (RBT) algorithms to store population data of cities. The implementation includes insertion, deletion, searching, sorting, and other fundamental operations on the trees. The project aims to demonstrate the differences between BST and RBT insertion and deletion procedures, along with their respective properties

## Features

The project consists of implementing the following functionalities for both BST and RBT:
- **Tree Insertion**: Inserting nodes into the tree while maintaining the tree properties.
- **Tree Deletion**: Removing nodes from the tree while preserving the tree properties.
- **Tree Search**: Searching for a specific node with a given value.
- **Sorting**: Implementing functions to return the ordered list of nodes in ascending order.
- **Fundamental Operations**: Implementing operations to find the minimum, maximum, successor, and predecessor of nodes.


## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code files (`main.cpp`).
3. Compile the source code files using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):

    ```
    g++ main.cpp -o main
    ```

4. Run the compiled executables with the dataset file name and output file name as arguments:

    ```
    ./main <DATASET_FILE_NAME>.csv out.csv v
    ```

    The `v` argument is optional for verbose output.

5. Review the generated output files (`log.txt`, `rb_out.csv`, and `bst_out.csv`) for the results.

## Testing and Evaluation

- Different scenarios such as insertion, deletion, searching, and sorting have been tested to verify the functionalities of both Red-Black Tree and Binary Search Tree implementations.
- The performance of the algorithms has been evaluated in terms of time complexity, memory usage, and scalability.
- Comparative analysis between Red-Black Tree and Binary Search Tree has been conducted to determine their advantages and disadvantages in different scenarios.
