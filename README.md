# Algorithms

This repository contains distinct projects, each focusing on different algorithms and data structures:

## Heapsort Project

The Heapsort Project implements various procedures related to heaps and priority queues. These include MAX-HEAPIFY, BUILD-MAX-HEAP, HEAPSORT, priority queue operations, and d-ary heap operations. These procedures are essential for maintaining heap properties, efficiently sorting arrays, and performing priority queue operations. The project includes implementations for both binary heaps and d-ary heaps.

## Binary Search Tree (BST) and Red-Black Tree (RBT) Project

This project focuses on implementing Binary Search Tree (BST) and Red-Black Tree (RBT) algorithms to store population data of cities. It covers insertion, deletion, searching, sorting, and other fundamental operations on the trees. The goal is to illustrate the differences between BST and RBT insertion and deletion procedures, along with their respective properties.

## Quicksort and Insertion Sort Project

The Quicksort and Insertion Sort Project implements various versions of the Quicksort algorithm, along with a hybrid approach combining Quicksort and Insertion Sort. The project aims to explore different pivoting strategies and compare their performance on sorting datasets of varying sizes.



For detailed information about each project, refer to the individual README files in their respective directories.
